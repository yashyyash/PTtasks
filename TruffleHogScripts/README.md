## Purpose of the Script

This script is designed to automate the setup and configuration of TruffleHog, a tool that detects secrets and sensitive information, such as keys and tokens, in repositories. TruffleHog can scan through Git history and current files to identify high-entropy strings and common secrets.

## Key Features

- **Automated Installation**: Automatically downloads and installs the appropriate version of TruffleHog for your operating system and architecture.
- **Pre-commit Hook Setup**: Configures TruffleHog as a pre-commit hook in your Git repository to automatically scan for secrets before commits and pushes.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Provides installation and setup instructions compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run Script Inside a Git Repository**: Ensure the script is executed from within a Git repository to successfully configure TruffleHog as a pre-commit hook.
2. **Download and Installation**: The script handles downloading the appropriate binary and setting up necessary environment configurations.
3. **Virtual Environment for Python**: Two versions of the script set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies such as pre-commit.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Script Must be Run Inside a Git Repository**
   - **Error**: This script must be run inside a git repository.
   - **Solution**: Ensure you are executing the script from a directory that is part of a Git repository. You can initialize a repository with `git init` if necessary.

2. **Unsupported Operating System or Architecture**
   - **Error**: Unsupported architecture or operating system.
   - **Solution**: Verify the operating system and architecture compatibility. The script supports:
     - macOS with x86_64 or arm64 architectures
     - Linux with x86_64 or aarch64 architectures
     - Windows with 64-bit architecture

3. **Download Failures**
   - **Error**: Failed to download.
   - **Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure `curl` or `wget` is installed. Also, verify the URL and file name in the script.

4. **Extraction or File Errors**
   - **Error**: Failed to extract or move files.
   - **Solution**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to extract and move files. For Linux/macOS, make sure to run the script with `sudo` if required.

5. **Environment Variable PATH Not Updated**
   - **Error**: The installation directory is not in the PATH.
   - **Solution**: Manually add the installation directory to your PATH environment variable if the script fails to do so. For Windows, restart your terminal after setting the environment variable.

### Python Virtual Environment Issues

1. **Python or Pip Not Found**
   - **Error**: Pip or Python not found.
   - **Solution**: Ensure Python and Pip are installed and available in your PATH. Check the installation with `python --version` and `pip --version`.

2. **Pre-commit Hook Installation Fails**
   - **Error**: Failed to install pre-commit hook.
   - **Solution**: Check virtual environment activation. Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install pre-commit`.

## Checking and Updating TruffleHog Version

- **Check Installed Version**: Use `trufflehog --version` to verify installation and version.
- **Update TruffleHog**: If a new version is available, update the download URL in the script and re-run it.
